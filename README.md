# Introduction

A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. <br>
MemoriseIT is an engaging, web-based memory card matching game that challenges your concentration and cognitive skills. 
The game presents you with a grid of cards, each displaying an image when flipped. 
Your goal is to find and match pairs of identical cards hidden within the grid. By flipping two cards at a time, you try to memorize their positions and match them. 
The game rewards sharp memory, quick thinking, and attention to detail.

## Some of the inbuild functions that we will use while coding:
 for loops  <br>
 addEventListener <br>
 setAttribute  <br>
 getAttribute  <br>
 data-name  <br>
 document.querySelector  <br>
 createElement

# How to Play:
### 1. Start the Game: <br> 
Once the game begins, all cards are laid out face down on the screen.
The cards are shuffled randomly, so each playthrough is unique.
### 2. Flip the Cards: <br>
Click on a card to reveal the image hidden on the other side. Then, click on a second card to reveal another image.
### 3. Find Matches: <br>
If the two flipped cards show the same image, they remain flipped, indicating a successful match. If the cards do not match, they flip back to their original state, and you must try again.
### 4. Score: <br>
For each successful match, you earn points, and a message is displayed on the screen and the score is incremented by "1". If your attempt is incorrect, a alert like "Oops! The match is incorrect ðŸ˜¢" will appear, encouraging you to keep trying.
### 5. Win the Game: <br>
The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched. A congratulatory message will display, celebrating your victory.
